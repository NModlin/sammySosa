OverviewGovCon Suite is a fully-automated, locally-hosted application designed to streamline the government contracting workflow for JACOB LYSICK LLC. It provides an end-to-end solution, from automatically discovering new opportunities on SAM.gov to leveraging a powerful AI co-pilot to analyze solicitation documents and prepare winning proposals.The entire system runs in a self-contained Docker environment, making it secure, portable, and incredibly easy to set up and manage.2. Key FeaturesAutomated Opportunity Scraping: A background scheduler runs automatically every night to fetch new, relevant contract opportunities from SAM.gov.Interactive Dashboard: A clean web interface to view, search, and filter all collected opportunities.AI Bidding Co-pilot: A sophisticated tool for deep analysis of Statement of Work (SOW) documents.Automated SOW Analysis: Extracts key details like Scope of Work, Technical Specifications, Performance Metrics, Timelines, and Evaluation Criteria.Subcontractor SOW Drafting: Generates a concise SOW to send to potential partners for quotes.Live Partner Search: Performs a real-time web search to find local companies that can fulfill the work.Proposal Outline Generation: Creates a compliant proposal Table of Contents based directly on the government's evaluation criteria.100% Local & Private: All data, AI models, and processing run locally on your machine. Nothing is sent to the cloud.One-Command Setup: The entire application suite is managed by Docker Compose for a simple and reliable user experience.3. System ArchitectureThe application uses a simple and robust architecture orchestrated by Docker Compose:Application Container (app): A Python container running a multi-page Streamlit web application. This container houses the web dashboard, the AI Co-pilot, and a background scheduler for automated scraping.Database Container (db): A standard PostgreSQL container that stores all opportunity data. The database is persistent, meaning your data is safe even if you stop and restart the containers.The two containers are networked together, allowing the application to communicate with the database seamlessly.4. PrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:Docker & Docker Compose: Download Docker Desktop (it includes Compose).A valid SAM.gov API Key: You can get one from your SAM.gov Profile Page.5. Setup & InstallationFollow these steps to set up the GovCon Suite on your local machine.Step 1: Create Project StructureCreate a main folder for the project (e.g., govcon_suite). Inside it, place the four required files (govcon_suite.py, requirements.txt, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml) and create a subfolder named models.Your folder structure should look like this:/govcon_suite/\r |-- models/\r |-- docker-compose.yml\r |-- Dockerfile\r |-- govcon_suite.py\r |-- requirements.txt\r Step 2: Download the AI ModelThe AI Co-pilot requires a Large Language Model file.Click here to download the model file (mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf - ~4.4 GB).Place the downloaded .gguf file inside the models folder you created.Step 3: Configure Your API KeyOpen the govcon_suite.py file in a text editor.Find the line SAM_API_KEY = \"YOUR_SAM_API_KEY_HERE\" and replace the placeholder with your actual SAM.gov API key.Save the file.6. Running the ApplicationWith the setup complete, running the application is a single command.Open a terminal or command prompt.Navigate into your main project folder (govcon_suite).Run the following command:docker-compose up --build\r Docker will build the application image (this might take a few minutes the first time), download the PostgreSQL image, and start both containers. You will see a lot of log output in your terminal.7. How to Use the GovCon SuiteAccess the Application: Once the containers are running, open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:8501Navigation: Use the sidebar to switch between the two main pages:Opportunity Dashboard: View the data collected by the scraper. You can click the \"Run Scraper Now\" button to manually fetch the latest opportunities.AI Bidding Co-pilot: Upload a SOW document (PDF or DOCX) to begin the AI analysis workflow. Follow the on-screen tabs to perform your analysis.Automation: The scraper is scheduled to run automatically every morning at 3:00 AM. You do not need to do anything to keep the data fresh.To stop the application, go to your terminal where it's running and press Ctrl + C.",
