## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Test Architecture:**
- **Test Pyramid Approach:** Many unit tests, some integration tests, few end-to-end tests
- **MCP Integration Testing:** Generic tool validation with domain-specific contexts
- **Docker Environment:** Consistent testing environment across development and CI/CD
- **Database Testing:** In-memory SQLite for unit tests, PostgreSQL for integration tests

### **Key Testing Patterns:**

#### **1. MCP Integration Testing Pattern:**
```python
def test_mcp_tool_integration(self):
    payload = {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "method": "tools/call",
        "params": {
            "name": "extract_structured_data",
            "arguments": {
                "text": document_text,
                "schema": expected_schema,
                "domain_context": "government_contracting"
            }
        }
    }
    response = requests.post(mcp_server_url, json=payload)
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
```

#### **2. Database Testing Pattern:**
```python
def test_database_operation(self):
    with self.test_engine.connect() as conn:
        # Test data insertion
        result = conn.execute(table.insert().values(test_data))
        conn.commit()
        
        # Verify insertion
        count = conn.execute(text("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table")).fetchone()[0]
        self.assertEqual(count, expected_count)
```

#### **3. End-to-End Testing Pattern:**
```python
def test_user_workflow(self):
    self.driver.get(self.base_url)
    # Navigate through user workflow
    # Verify expected outcomes
    self.assertIn("expected_content", self.driver.page_source)
```
